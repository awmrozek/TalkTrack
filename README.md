TalkTrack
=========

TalkTrack is a solution for tracking your phone calls and categorizing it. If you ever found out that you have too many phone calls and your digital life feels not so organized, this solution can help you.

The solution consists of an Android app which uploads your call log and contact info to your local instance of TalkTrack. The TalkTrack Android server takes care of your contacts and stores it in a PostgreSQL database. Then, you have TalkTrackBackend and TalkTrackFrontend which build a web service to manage adnotations.
